Data Analytics Project showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL, and Power BI
Data Analytics Project
Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data ingestion to business insights and visualization.
It covers data loading in Python, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying across multiple databases, and dashboard/report creation using Power BI and Gamma.

The goal is to showcase practical analytics skills commonly used in real-world data analyst roles.

Dataset
> Source: [customer_shopping_behavior]
> Format: Excel
> Size: [406 KB]
> Description:
  The dataset contains structured data used to analyze trends, patterns, and key performance
  metrics relevant to the business problem.

Tools & Technologies
> Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
> SQL
  > PostgreSQL
  > MySQL
  > SQL Server
> Power BI (Interactive dashboard)
> Gamma (Presentation creation)
> Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
> Git & GitHub

Project Steps
1. Data Loading
  > Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.
  > Verified schema, data types, and basic structure.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  > Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.
  > Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
  > Created visualizations to support insights.

3. Data Cleaning & Preparation
  > Handled missing and duplicate values.
  > Standardized formats and corrected data types.
  > Created derived columns where needed.

4. SQL Analysis
  > Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server.
  > Wrote SQL queries for:
    > Aggregations
    > Filtering and joins
    > KPI calculations
  > Validated SQL results against Python analysis.

5. Dashboard Development
  > Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.
  > Included key metrics, trends, and filters.
  > Designed for clarity and business usability.

Reporting & Presentation
  > Created a structured analytics report summarizing findings.
  > Developed a presentation using Gamma to communicate insights clearly to stakeholders.

Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:
  > High-level KPIs
  > Trend analysis
  > Category and segment breakdowns
  > Interactive filters for deeper exploration

Results & Insights
  > Identified key trends and patterns in the data.
  > Highlighted actionable insights to support decision-making.
  > Demonstrated consistency between Python, SQL, and Power BI outputs.

How to Run the Project
  1. Clone the repository:
    > git clone https://github.com/Princekamkar/Customer_Behavior_Analysis.git

  2. Install required Python libraries:
    > pip install -r requirements.txt

  3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in order:
    > Data loading & EDA
    > Data cleaning
    > SQL analysis

  4. Load the cleaned dataset into your SQL database (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server).
  5. Open the Power BI file and refresh the data connection.
  6. Review the report and presentation for final insights.
